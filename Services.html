            We view our role in the financial reporting process as an opportunity to provide
            constructive solutions for maximizing your company's profitability and efficiency.
            Compilations differ from reviews and audits as they are based upon client information
            provided and used primarily for internal use only as no assurance is expressed.
            Reviews differ from audits as they are lesser in scope and rely on interviews of
            management personnel and analytical procedures.

        <p class="explain">
            Effective estate and gift planning facilitates the orderly transfer of assets to
            your beneficiaries, provides security for your surviving spouse, and can reduce or
            eliminate the tax due on the transfer of your business and other assets. For business
            owners, providing for business continuity and succession of ownership is essential. We
