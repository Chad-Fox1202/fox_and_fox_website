            will run more efficiently on a daily basis and are the foundation of a successful 
            business. Whether you do your own bookkeeping in-house via Quickbooks or have us

         <h4 id="Compilations">Compilations and Reviews</h4>

        <p class="explain">
            We view our role in the financial reporting process as an opportunity to provide 
            constructive solutions for maximizing your company's profitability and efficiency. 
            Compilations differ from reviews and audits as they are based upon client information
            provided and used primarily for internal use only as no assurance is expressed.  
            Reviews differ from audits as they are lesser in scope and rely on interviews of 
            management personnel and analytical procedures. 
         </p>

         <h4 id="Financial-Statements">Financial Statements</h4>

         <p class="explain">
             We can assist you in the preparation of your financial statements in accordance 
             with professional standards, but express no opinion or any other form of assurance 
             on the underlying information included in them. The financial statements produced 
             can be a useful tool for management for making financial decisions.
          </p>

          <h4 id="Payroll-Services">Payroll Services</h4>

        <p class="explain">
            As a business grows, it must hire more employees, which can result in increased 
            payroll administration. We can assist you in implementing the controls necessary 
            to ensure a reliable, efficient, and effective payroll system. Our firm can also 
            help you develop a payroll system and prepare all necessary payroll tax returns in 
            a timely manner.

            We gauge our worth by the personal and business successes of our clients. We can

         <h4 id="Estate&Trust-Tax-Preparation">Estate & Trust Tax Preparation</h4>

        <p class="explain">
            Effective estate and gift planning facilitates the orderly transfer of assets to 
            your beneficiaries, provides security for your surviving spouse, and can reduce or 
            eliminate the tax due on the transfer of your business and other assets. For business 
            owners, providing for business continuity and succession of ownership is essential. We 
            can guide you through the complex process of getting your financial affairs in order.

            Choosing the form of entity of your business (e.g. "S" corporation, sole proprietor, 
            limited liability company…) is a crucial decision that can have longstanding tax 
            implications, positive or negative. We can assist you in evaluating the pros and 
            cons of each entity type to help you determine the most advantageous form of business 
            for your company.

         <h4 id="Pension&Profit-Sharing-Plans">Pension & Profit Sharing Plans</h4>

         <p class="explain">
               Qualified retirement plans (e.g. defined-contribution or defined benefit plans, 
               Keoghs, SEPs…) can provide significant tax advantages for closely held businesses 
               and self-employed individuals. Our qualified staff can assist you in evaluating the
