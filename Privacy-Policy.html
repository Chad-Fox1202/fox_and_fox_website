    <h5>Privacy Policy </h5>
   
    <p>
        As required by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the related Federal Trade Commission
        regulations on the disclosure of personal and financial information, following is our privacy policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br><br>Certified Public Accountants have been and continue to be bound by professional 
      standards of confidentiality that are even more stringent than those required by law. 
      We have always protected your right to privacy.
    </p>

    <p>
        <br>We obtain nonpublic personal information about you that is provided to us by you 
        or obtained by us with your authorization. For current and former clients, we do not disclose 
        any nonpublic personal information obtained in the course of our practice except as required 
        or permitted by law. Permitted disclosures include, for instance, providing information to 
        our employees, and in limited situations, to unrelated third parties who need to know that 
        information to assist us in providing services to you. In all such situations, we stress the 
        confidential nature of information being shared.
      </p>

      <p>
        <br>We retain records relating to professional services that we provide so that we 
        are better able to assist you with your professional needs and, in some cases, to comply 
        with professional guidelines. In order to guard your nonpublic personal information, we 
        maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with our professional 
        standards.
      </p>

      <p>
        <br>Please call if you have any questions, because your privacy, our professional 
        ethics, and the ability to provide you with quality financial services are very important 
        to us. 
      </p>
